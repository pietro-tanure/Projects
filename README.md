# Projects
##### This is a repository of different projects and toy codes that I have done 
##### Many of the projects presented here have been edited or taken out of their most practical context for this overview.

## `movie_recommendation_model`
### Content-based recommendation model with Gradient-Boosting Regressor
- `Python` : pandas, numpy, lightgbm, matplotlib

Entire workflow of the construction of a content-based recommendation model for movies using Gradient-Boosting Machine. From acquiring the data, preprocessing it, visualizing the statistics, constructing the feature for the model and finally constructing a recommendation model.

## `crow_instability`
### Simulation and stability analysis of Crow Instability 
#### 2021 - M2 Fluid Mechanics at X.
- `Python` : FEniCS, SciPy, Matplotlib
- `gmsh`

This work integrates meshes generated with the gmsh tool with the FEniCS library, used to solve PDEs with Python through finite elements.
At first, the dynamics of a vortex dipole is simulated by means of a linearized Navier-Stokes direct resolution (baseflow.py).
Then, the tools learned in class for spectral analysis of flow stability and optimal perturbations are used (EVP.py).

## `flow_instability`
### Files for research projet on flow instability develloped at PMMH with Laurette Tuckerman 
#### 2021 - M2 Fluid Mechanics at X.
- `Python` : SciPy, Matplotlib

Files for research projet on flow instability develloped at PMMH with Laurette Tuckerman
- Heat equation solved with finite difference method in space and runge kutta 4.5 in time
- Couette flow equations proposed by Dwight Barkley "Modeling the transition to turbulence in shear flows" implemented in finite difference with runge kutta 4.5 in time

## `image_recognition`
### Image recognition methods studied during computer vision course at ENSTA
#### 2020 - 2A ENSTA Paris
- `Python` : cv2, scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib

Basic computer vision models and operations like: convolutions, feature detections, Harris point of interest, k-means clustering, feature matching, PCA

## `lorenz_attractor`
### Lorenza system solution and visualization

- `Python` : odeint, Matplotlib animation, 3d, numpy

Solution of Lorenz's system of ordinary differential equations and visualization

## `RBM`
### Restricted Boltzman Machine
#### 2022 - IA304 Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning (Telecom Paris)

- `Python` : scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib

 Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) algorithm done for the course  IA304-Probabilistic Models and Machine Learning  at Telecom Paris

## Other projects

Many other projects were put aside for confidentiality reasons (as in the case of the internship I did at ONERA Aerospace Laboratory or ISQ), or because of my carelessness in having lost them.
